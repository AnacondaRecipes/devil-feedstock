Since release 1.18.0 some fixes have been made to accommodate more stringent
type checking of boolean values passed to the jpeg API (introduced in version
8). This patch is a minimal equivalent fix.

TRUE and FALSE can be interpreted as either macro definitions
or values of the enum boolean type both defined in the jpeg 
header files. Depending on a compile time definition the jconfig.h
header may be included as part of these header files. Macro definitions
in downstreams can vary based on these two situations.
This patch for this library is to define TRUE and FALSE as macros
and then pass a macro that expands to TRUE or FALSE. Directly using
1 or 0 fails with a type casting error during compilation (inferred to
be due to 1 and 0 not being in the boolean enum).
